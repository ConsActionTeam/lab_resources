# Lab meeting resources

We currently join the Seascale models lab meetings. These meetinsg are fortnightly and often cover practical topics related to research, teaching and service. In many cases useful resources are shared. This repository acts as an archive for these resources to revisit in the future.

It's also worth checking out our [Methods repo](https://github.com/pinskylab/pinskylab_methods), including our [Cookbook](https://github.com/pinskylab/pinskylab_methods/blob/master/cookbook.md) on how to solve common research problems we all face.
