# Tips for successful conference presentations

Conference presentations range from 10-15 minutes. Here are some useful tips discussed at our lab meeting (March 2023)

1. Know your audience and tailor to them
2. Don't get stuck in the weeds. Bring it back to the big picture.
3. Have one key message and repeat it often (in different ways)
4. Bring the audience back in at ~6 minutes (this is when their attention starts to wander)
5. Keep slides simple (~1 slide/minute of presentation), limit words on slides
6. Be conscious of your speed. Most people tend to go too fast (but some can also over compensate and go too slow).
7. Thoroughly explain figures/graphs (What are the axes? What do the colors mean?) - bring the audience with you, this is likely their first time seeing your work.
8. Take your time in answering questions. It is OK to repeat the question to make sure you understood or have the person rephrase. There is much on this topic we could cover later!


# Why present at a conference?

1. Share your work - let others know what you are working on or recent publication(s)
2. Expand your network - meet new people at other organisations and get to know your colleagues better too.
3. Get inspired by other research
4. Receive feedback - this can help steer the direction of your research or point out areas you may want to address prior to submitting to a journal
5. Get a new perspective on your work - presenting can help you plan out a new research topic or bring you back to the big picture of a project you have worked on for years.
6. Get experience and confidence in public speaking to different audiences

# Steps in creating a presentation

1. Storyboard - before you get to creating slides map out your story
2. Talk through it - talk through your story to get an idea of its flow. This will likely reveal things you want to switch or around or have missed.
3. Get feedback on your story from your supervisor - make sure you are on the right track
3. Create slides - once you have the story and flow down, start making your slides and sourcing compelling visuals
4. Practice, practice, practice - set up a time to practice in a lab meeting, practice with friends outside of research as well
5. Refine - incorporate any feedback and last minute changes before a final practice.
6. Present - it's showtime! Take a deep breath, you know your work better than anyone else.
7. Reflect - afterwards reflect on what went well and what you could potentially improve for next time. Follow up with 8. Follow up - after the conference, reach out to any contacts you may have made from the conference interested in your work
